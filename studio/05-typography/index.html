      <p class="description">
        Another extremely important visual aspect of film poster design is typography. Typography in film posters is
        used to display a film title, main actors in a film, directors, a motto, a quote and/or other essential
        information. Good film posters aim to select a typeface that all at once attracts an audience while revealing
        an idea, ambiance, style, theme…of the film. The selected typeface may in itself portray the desire effect or
        be edited to do so. I take in example the typefaces used in the poster for <span class= "highlight one">
        The Heathers</span>, a high school clique “chick flick” themed movie. The foreground of the poster shows
        the main characters, two high school lovers, caressing one another in front of a classroom chalkboard.
        Alone, this image already reveals the theme of the film, introduces main characters… Additionally, the film
        title is positioned above all, largely, in the center top of the poster. The selected font is a hot pink
        chalkboard handwriting-looking one. These distinct typographic decisions release more information about the
        film. They give a taste of the high school, girly theme in the film. These sorts of theme-revealing typographic
        choices are also visible in the posters for <span class= "highlight two">La La Land</span>,
        <span class= "highlight three">Call Me By Your Name</span> and <span class= "highlight four">Amélie</span>.

      Another trend in film title typography in posters is the addition of plot elements merged with film titles. An example
      of this would be in the typography for the posters of the <span class= "highlight five">Harry Potter</span> series. The main character’s unique scar’s form
      is merged with the bottom of the letter “P” in “Potter”. These types of elements are also visible in the posters for
      <span class= "highlight six">The Godfather</span>, <span class= "highlight seven">The Devil Wears Prada</span> and <span class= "highlight eight">Looper</six>.

       film themes they could correspond to.
