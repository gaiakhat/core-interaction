<p>It is said that Jules Cheret created the first film poster in 1890 for a film called “Projections Artistiques”.

As the movie industry developed, film poster designs did as well with the intention getting people to buy movie tickets. Today, the designing of a film poster has become quite a complex art.

I’d like to begin analyzing these designs by pulling focus on the differences in film campaigns throughout different cultures.

Clink on the link below to see a few examples:

As you could see, one same film is marketed very differently depending on the country it is being shown in. The examples that especially caught my eye are those that compare film posters from the United States to those of Japan. The United State’s posters of films like The Wolverine, Nebraska, Frozen, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, Hercules… are presented simply and contain one main point of focus, usually a character and a title. The posters of these same films, in Japan however are much more visually dense with multiple points of focus, multiple characters, heavy background imagery and text all around. Also, in the Japanese poster for the Wolverine, the main character is shown in the center of the poster holding a Samurai sword, which he does not have in the United State’s version.

I found that the integration of Japanese culture in an advertisement for American films created a significant and interesting difference between the advertisements we have seen here, in the United States. I would like to explore further what this could reveal about film advertising internationally.
