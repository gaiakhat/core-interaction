      <p class="description">
        I will be bringing attention to a technique used frequently in film poster design: multiple exposure photography.
        <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_exposure" class="weblink description">“In photography and cinematography, a multiple exposure is the superimposition of two or more exposures to create
        a single image, and double exposure has a corresponding meaning in respect of two images.”</a>.
        This technique allows a designer to superimpose multiple images relevant to a film to create one. Usually, two
        images are exposed in movie posters. This is useful to the design of film posters because it allows plenty of
        information to fit in a pleasant manner onto the limited amount of space in a film poster.  With the elaborate
        editing technology we have today, through editors like <a ref= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbf-QXCCXgM" class="weblink description">Photoshop</a>,
        a multiple exposure image could be created in minutes. A great example of this editing technique is in the poster
        of <span class="highlight one description" data-id="tt1596345">Pawn Sacrifice</span>. The film tells the story of the legendary chess player Bobby Fischer. The superimposed images
        are of Fischer’s character’s profile and of chessboard checkers, chess pieces and position codes. Another example
        of multiple exposures in a film poster is in the poster for the film <span class="highlight two description" data-id="tt5294550">All The Money In The World</span>. The film recounts
        the true story of the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III. The kidnapping story involved large sums of money as well
        as a cut ear. In the poster of this film, we see an image in the center of an ear, alone, cut and bloody. Superimposed
        to this image is the image of printed hundred dollar bills. More of this editing technique appears in the posters for
        <span class="highlight three description" data-id="tt0780504">Drive</span> and <span class="highlight four description" data-id="tt0166924">Mulholland Drive</span>.</p>
