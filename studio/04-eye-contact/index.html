        The purpose of a film poster is to seduce an audience towards a film. This is done by using the most recognizable
        standard 27” x 41” space to attractively present content of the film. I have found that one common composition in
        film posters: a close-up photographic representation of a main character looking directly at the audience while
        secondary elements expose more of the film’s substance. Some examples of this composition are for <span class="highlight one description" data-id="tt0099785">
        Home Alone</span>, a Chris Colombus film, <span class="highlight two description" data-id="tt0091042">Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</span>, a
        John Hughes film, <span class="highlight three description" data-id="tt4975722">Moonlight</span>, a Barry Jenkins film, <span class="highlight four description" data-id="tt0102926">
        The Silence of the Lambs</span>, a Jonathan Demme film.

        What is it about character-to-audience and audience-to-character eye contact that sells a film so well?
        <a href= "http://www.businessinsider.com/where-models-look-in-ads-2014-11" class="weblink description">Business Insider</a> explains that in
        advertising, a viewer’s eye tends to follow the gaze of a model. When a model looks straight into a camera, it
        immediately includes the audience into the scene. How does this effect translate to film posters? A character on
        a film poster looking straight into the eyes of a viewer instantly causes the viewer to feel engaged into the
        presented scene. Secondary film-revealing elements such as background location, other characters, costumes and
        objects play a role here to then offer a step into the character’s surrounding universe. This then causes a viewer
        to desire further discovery into the film. Additionally, <a href= "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12886-eye-contact-and-a-smile-will-win-you-a-mate/" class="weblink description">
        New Scientist</a>, after having conducted studies, states that making eye contact with a person will make them seem
        more attractive. Giving the illusion that an actor is making eye contact rom a poster will make them seem more
       attractive to a passerby and therefore offer greater success to the film.
